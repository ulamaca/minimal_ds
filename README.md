## Minimal Python Devevelopment Env for Data Scientist
an easy script to build up Data Science development envronment. Scripts are available in multiple formats:
1. python
```
     python3 minimal_ds_py.py
```
but unfortunately, it did not work... (this is done by GPT3.5)
2. .csh
3. .sh
    + 1. execute . ./minimal_ds_sh.sh
    + 1.1 the . is necessary!

## TODO
1. zsh and more setup to make terminal more customized and DS-friendly
2. other approaches: (1) Docker, (2) Collab, (3) Conda (Miniconda)
